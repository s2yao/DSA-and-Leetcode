Read question very carefully

Printing for loop in reverse order:

```python
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
# prints from 10 to 1
for i in reversed(range(1, 11))
# also prints from 10 to 1
```

Whenever doing a loop inside a loop, use a different various

```python

for i in range(10):
	for j in range(10):
# do this, dont have 2 "i"s
```

When having a “success” case in a loop, remember to manually adjust the position of index

When doing a while loop, remember to update the index

When looping a linked list, remember to update the looper

fast and slow pointer will put slow ptr to the middle of the linked list

use 3 ptrs to reverse a LL

when a function is defined within an outer function, the inner function can only access the variables defined in the outter function scope.

- if inner function wants to alter variables, use a “mutable container” (list of length 1)
